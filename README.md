<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="readme-assets/suika-title.png" alt="Logo" width="240" height="120">

**What is Suika?**

Suika is a viral game that has taken the innternet by storm over the past two weeks. It is equal-parts satisfying and frustrating, and is always extremely hard to put down. We wanted 

Suika Symphony is an innovative project that transforms the traditional Suika game into an engaging educational tool for children to learn and understand music theory. Developed for the MHacks hackathon, Suika Symphony combines the excitement of the original game with educational elements, creating a fun and interactive platform for young learners.

**What is Suika Symphony**

Instead of conventional fruit slices, Suika Symphony features musical notes that combine in fun and accurate ways. Each slice corresponds to a specific note on the musical scale or to a specific measure of musical time.

**Chord Challenges:**

Players engage in musical challenges where they must hit the correct fruit notes in sequence to create chords. In the future, the successful completion of challenges advances players to more complex musical compositions. Currently, a diverse collection of chords can be made including five different tri-tones and twelve different two-note combinations. 

**Rhythm and Timing:**

Suika Symphony incorporates rhythm and timing elements into the gameplay, helping children develop a sense of musical timing and coordination as they slice through the musical fruits along to the groovy background music.

**Interactive Lessons:**

The game includes interactive lessons on fundamental music theory concepts such as pitch and tempo. These lessons are seamlessly integrated into the gameplay, ensuring an immersive learning experience.

**Virtual Music Instructor:**

One goal for the future is to implement a virtual music instructor that can guide players through the game, providing feedback, tips, and encouragement. This character serves as a mentor, making the learning process more engaging and enjoyable, and would be based of a language model API.

**Customizable Learning Paths:**

Suika Symphony allows customization of learning paths based on the child's age and skill level, ensuring that the educational content aligns with individual learning needs.

**Educational Goals:**

Suika Symphony aims to achieve the following educational objectives:

Introduce children to the basics of music theory in a playful and entertaining manner.
Foster a love for music by making learning an enjoyable experience.
Develop essential cognitive skills such as memory, attention, and coordination through gameplay.
Provide a foundation for future music education endeavors.

**Why Suika Symphony?**

Suika Symphony is not just a game; it's a creative approach to make music education accessible and enjoyable for children. By combining the excitement of the Suika game with educational content, Suika Symphony empowers young minds to embark on a musical journey while having a blast at the same time.
